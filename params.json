Requires iOS 8.0+ for HealthKit.\r\n\r\n## Class Overview\r\n\r\n### General\r\n\r\n##### STPYAppDelegate\r\n\r\nThe application delegate. Loads the UIAppearence attributes, starts GameKit authentication in STPYGCHelper, and gets called for background refreshes.\r\n\r\n##### STPYColor\r\n\r\nExtension of UIColor. Includes the application background colors and also helps in creating colors for smooth transition between other colors.\r\n\r\n##### STPYNavigationBarView\r\n\r\nThe view that appears to extend the navigation bar. Used in STPYLeaderboardViewController\r\n\r\n##### STPYSummaryView\r\n\r\nThe view that appears in the top scroll view in STPYGraphViewController.\r\n\r\n##### STPYGraphView\r\n\r\nThe view that contains and manages a single graph.\r\n\r\n##### STPYGraphBar\r\n\r\nEach bar in a STPYGraphView. Has another UIView inside of it that appears to grow/shrink in the eyes of the user, but actually stays constant to easily detect touches.\r\n\r\n### Helpers\r\n\r\n##### STPYGCHelper\r\n\r\nHandles Game Center authentication, leaderboard data downloading, and submitting step counts.\r\n\r\n##### STPYHKManager\r\n\r\nThe link between HealthKit and the app. Queries data and saves it for display.\r\n\r\n##### STPYDataHelper\r\n\r\nLink to NSUserDefaults for classes to easily save and load data.\r\n\r\n##### STPYDateHelper\r\n\r\nContains NSDate extensions that help with storing data. Also gets localized day abbreviations for the graphs.\r\n\r\n##### STPYFormatter\r\n\r\nClass to reuse various NSFormatters that are used throughout the app.\r\n\r\n##### STPYCMHelper\r\n\r\nGets the lastest step data from the Core Motion framework instead of HealthKit.\r\n\r\n### View Controllers\r\n\r\n##### STPYGraphViewController\r\n\r\nThe main view controller of the app. Displays the step data in the form of interactive graphs in a scroll view.\r\n\r\n##### STPYModalViewController\r\n\r\nThe view controller all other modal view controllers in the app inherit from. Allows for consitent button style setting and easily adding menu/dismiss/done button to controllers. Also helps in making sure background color is the same as the STPYGraphViewController.\r\n\r\n##### STPYAboutViewController\r\n\r\nThe view controller that displays basic infomation about the app (name/version/build). Also allows the user to toggle Game Center features.\r\n\r\n##### STPYLeaderboardViewController\r\n\r\nThe view controller that displays the step count leaderboards. Only enabled if the user is signed into Game Center. Uses a UISegmenetedControl to allow the user to select leaderboard time span.\r\n\r\n##### STPYSetupViewController\r\n\r\nThe view controller that displays on first launch of the app. Allows the user to sign into Game Center and authenticate app with HealthKit.\r\n\r\n##### STPYGraphExtensionViewController\r\n\r\nThe view controller for the graph extension in Notification Center.\r\n\r\n##### STPYStepTableViewController\r\n\r\nThe view controller for the step count extension in Notification Center.\r\n\r\n## Common Questions\r\n\r\n### Hey Andrew, why is it free?\r\nAt this point in my life, seeing a high download count is more rewarding than a few extra dollars.\r\n\r\n### But why not have ads?\r\nI spent a lot of time crafting a simple, elegant user interface. I'm not going to ruin it by sticking an ad in the middle of it.\r\n\r\n## Thanks To\r\n\r\n### My Beta Testers\r\nThanks to William Preston, Sam Lim, Stephen Stearns, and Varun Gupta for being awesome beta testers. Especially Sam. Sam was pretty awesome. If you want to beta test any of my [future projects](http://i.imgur.com/JBVwMIP.png) send me an email from my [website](http://www.atfinkeproductions.com).\r\n\r\n### Apple\r\nThanks to Apple for allowing me attend WWDC 2012-14 on [student scholarship](https://developer.apple.com/wwdc/students/). It's my Disneyland.\r\n","google":"UA-48283712-3","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
